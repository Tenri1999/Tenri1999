# Welcome to my profile! ðŸ˜‰
I've been in love with code since middle school, having learned my first programming language on my own by playing a game called [Garry's Mod](https://gmod.facepunch.com) at that time. In high school, I found out little by little about how to make some pages by messing around, and so I started to look around for resources, deciding a few years ago to make it my job, since that's what speaks to me the most nowadays.

# What am I capable of? ðŸ’ª
I've worked on many projects over the past years, centered around games and their communities. I started out with voluntary work as part of the [Meta Construct](https://metastruct.net) team, testing the waters with web development and gameplay improvements. Now, I am taking **commissions** for gaming communities that I communicate with closely, and creating products for sale on **[GmodStore](https://gmodstore.com)** for them to use.

# And now? ðŸŒ 
I am currently looking for a **web development work-study** for my second year of training at [La Plateforme_ Marseille](https://laplateforme.io) that I started in September 2019, in order to become a professional **full-stack web developer** and further improve my skills that I have taught myself as a hobbyist.
