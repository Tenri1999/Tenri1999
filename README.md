# Welcome to my profile! ðŸ˜‰
I've been in love with code since middle school, having learned my first programming language on my own by playing a game called [Garry's Mod](https://gmod.facepunch.com). In high school, I found out little by little about how to make some pages by messing around, and so I started to look around for resources, deciding a few years ago to make it my job, since that's what speaks to me the most nowadays.

I've worked on many projects over the past years, centered around games and their communities. I started out with voluntary work as part of the [Meta Construct](https://metastruct.net) team, testing the waters with web development and gameplay improvements. Now, I am taking **commissions** for gaming communities with which I communicate closely, and creating products for sale on **[GmodStore](https://gmodstore.com)** for them to use.

I am currently looking for a **web development work-study** for my second year of training at [La Plateforme_ Marseille](https://laplateforme.io) which continues in September, in order to become a professional **full-stack web developer** and further improve my skills.
