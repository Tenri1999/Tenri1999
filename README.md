# Welcome to my profile! ðŸ˜‰

I've been in love with code since middle school, having worked on many projects, centered around games and their communities. 

I started out in middle school with voluntary work as part of the [Meta Construct](https://metastruct.net) team, testing the waters with programming as a whole.

Nowadays, I take **commissions** for gaming communities with which I communicate closely, create products for sale on **[GmodStore](https://gmodstore.com)** for them to use, and I am currently looking for a **web development work-study** for my second year of training at [La Plateforme_ Marseille](https://laplateforme.io) which continues in September.

If I've got you interested, feel free to get in touch as well as check out [my portfolio](https://marceau-maubert.students-laplateforme.io), and hopefully we can work on something together!

You can also find me on [ðŸ¦Š GitLab](https://gitlab.com/marceau-maubert) and [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/marceau-maubert).
